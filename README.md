 CALDINING APP
 
 An app that scrapes the online CalDining Menus page and based on that and a list of food preferences that the user provides upon opening the app (and can later modify) as well as a list of preferred food dining places, sends notifications to the user recommendations each day regarding which meals at which dining halls the user would like the most. 
 
The user chooses from a list of given items and then the algorithm maximizes either the total star rating or if the user says that for certain days they can only stay Northside, it just gives you the menu for Foothill. A possible implementation if we have time is to integrate the Google Maps API and, based on the list of foods you like or want to eat on a given day, and if in your schedule you say you want to stay on a certain area of campus for a given meal (depending on possible classes you might have in that area), it suggests possible restaurants that are in that area of campus.
