 CALDINING APP
 
 An app that scrapes the online CalDining Menus page and based on that and a list of food preferences that the user provides upon opening the app (and can later modify) as well as a list of preferred food dining places, sends notifications to the user recommendations each day regarding which meals at which dining halls the user would like the most. 
 
 The user choose a list of given items and then the algorithm in the backend would try to maximize either the total star rating or if the user says that for certain days they can only stay Northside, it just gives you the menu for Foothill. A possible implementation if we have time is to integrate the Google Maps API and, based on the list of foods you like or want to eat on a given day, and if in your schedule you say you want to stay on a certain area of campus for a given meal (depending on possible classes you might have in that area), it suggests possible restaurants that are in that area of campus.
 
 
 Other ideas:
 
 -app that compiles posts from free and for sale, lists it in a nice/more easy to navigate format (by category like free, housemates needed, housing, for sale textbooks, etc)
 
 -App that lets you go back into photos/facebook photos/insta/twitter and show you what you shared 1,2,3,4,etc years in the past
 
 -An app that gives you ideas of what to do based on: your interests, your budget, transportation near you (if you have a car/bus/uber nearby), weather, how much time you have, etc
 
 -Cal dining app (menus), would be basic
 
 -An app that takes info about cryptocurrency and translates your profits/losses clearly based on the price you bought each “set” of crypto at (e.g. .1 BTC at 9k = 900 original price, say crypto is 10k today, it shows your profit on .1 crypto bought 1/1/18 is $100, up 11%, etc), and tells you your overall profit for a given time period (would have to keep track of your buy/sells like distribute however much you sold out of how many “sets” of investments you have, to keep track of your overall profit/losses)
 
 -app that searches for a song online and downloads that song for you (can use youtube -> mp3 converter, or look recursively through websites to find an mp3 file download link, then make sure the length of the song is roughly correct to verify that you have found the right mp3 file)
 
 -app that calls or texts you in awkward situations if you press a certain combination (or open the app or something), so you have an excuse to leave.
 
 -an app that takes info from ebay/amazon/other trading websites (price, condition, etc) and establishes an average “market” price for an item based on the stuff it has found.
 
 -app that is a marketplace for favors. You can list a job using favor points (include approx location, how difficult/far the favor is based on location/type), asking for someone to do the job (like go grab me a coffee, etc), and that person will grab you the coffee, and receive those favor points. You can buy favor points/sell favor points for money.
